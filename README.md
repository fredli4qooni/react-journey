# React Journey

> **Status:** In Progress (Phase 1: JavaScript Foundations)
> **Goal:** To bridge the gap between *writing code* and *software architecture* in the React ecosystem.

## About This Repository

This repository is not just a collection of tutorials. It documents my structured journey to mastering the modern React ecosystem (Next.js 15, Server Components, TypeScript).

I follow the **“Mastery Through Documentation”** methodology: true understanding is demonstrated by the ability to explain complex concepts clearly.

## Architecture Structure

| Directory       | Description                                                   |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`/docs`**     | My theoretical knowledge base, deep dives, and daily DevLogs. |
| **`/projects`** | Practical implementations (portfolios, dashboards, games).    |
| **`/snippets`** | Reusable logic, custom hooks, and utilities with JSDoc.       |
| **`/research`** | Technology comparisons and architectural analysis.            |

## 🛠 Tech Stack Focus

* **Core:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React 19
* **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, RSC)
* **State Management:** Context API, Zustand, React Query
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Testing:** Vitest, Playwright

## Documentation Protocol

Every coding session includes a “DevLog” that covers:

1. **Context:** What problem am I solving?
2. **Mechanism:** How does it work under the hood?
3. **Challenges:** Specific blockers and debugging steps.
4. **Implication:** How does this scale to real-world applications?
